#### Abstract
Hi everyone! I'm a third year statistics major at UCSB and I like learning, Rick and Morty, and hiking. You can either find me at the library or at a cafe enjoying a green tea latte. This is a simple get-to-know-me as I am familiarize myself with markdown format. 

Some of my projects include classification on healthcare issues and natural language processing. I am also filming a "One Second a Day" for the year of 2017 that is in the works. Ask me all about it!
